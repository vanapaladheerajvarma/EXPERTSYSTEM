# expert-system-for-homeopathy
In this project we store the details of patients who take treatment in our expert system. We also ask questions based to the patients. Based on their answers our expert system will recognise the disease they are suffering from and also prescribe a medicine for that disease. We also store the details of the patient who are diagnosed by our expert system. We also used constraint satisfaction for the patient name and their age which should only be a string and number.
